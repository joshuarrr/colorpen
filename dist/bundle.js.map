Shortcut\n\t     * fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids the creation\n\t     * of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of iteratee executions.\n\t     * Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut fusion if the section is\n\t     * applied to an array of at least two hundred elements and any iteratees\n\t     * accept only one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies\n\t     * for shortcut fusion is subject to change.\n\t     *\n\t     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n\t     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n\t     *\n\t     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n\t     *\n\t     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n\t
