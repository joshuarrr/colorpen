                    I've been working at <a href='http://www.idealist.org'>Idealist</a> since the beginning of 2012, where we employ an agile software development strategy against a broad and oftentimes daunting challenge: <em>how can we help more people do more good in the world</em>?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As their first full-time designer, I've championed design driven product development, user research, analytics tracking and a/b testing for data driven design decisions, and brought a clean design aesthetic and modern interface to the new responsive incarnation of the site.

                        For years, the Idealist ‘about us’ page was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141128135648/http://www.idealist.org/info/About" target="_blank">not very appealing or engaging</a>. Traffic was particularly poor and exit rates particularly high for this section of the site.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With the release of this new iteration, we wanted to validate the design. We were curious if people would scroll through the long introductory section. We employed <a href="http://scrolldepth.parsnip.io/" target="_blank">Scroll Depth</a>, a plugin that lets us analyze scroll behavior in Google Analytics.
